<p>The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, launched in 1972 and 1973,
respectively, were well named: they made the first crossings of the
asteroid belt and were the first to encounter Jupiter and its intense
radiation belts. Pioneer 11&rsquo;s trajectory, bent into a hairpin curve by
Jupiter&rsquo;s powerful gravitational field, allowed it to recross the solar
system to make the first flyby of Saturn almost a billion miles from
Earth where it came within 13,300 miles of the cloud tops.</p>
<p>Assembled in this publication is a selection of the pictures
returned by Pioneer 11 of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan. These
images are of great beauty as well as of great scientific interest, serving
to whet our appetite for the more detailed observations to be
made by Voyager in 1980 and 1981. Tracking of both Pioneers will
continue for many more years, providing fundamental data on the
nature of interplanetary space in the depths of the solar system. The
results of these outer-planet Pioneer missions have far exceeded our
hopes and expectations of a decade ago when the program was
initiated.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>We have entered into a new era of space exploration. Missions
undertaken during the lunar exploration of the 1960&rsquo;s typically
lasted a matter of days with commands issued and carried out in near
real time. Now, a decade later, planetary voyages may last for many
years as the spiraling trajectories of the spacecraft make periodic
intersections with the orbits of the planets. Communicating with us
across the vastness of space, these spacecraft report to us their experiences
as they traverse the outer reaches of the solar system.</p>
<p>Among these deep space travelers, Pioneers 10 and 11 are appropriately
named, for they truly are pioneering the exploration of the
outer solar system. Launched in 1972 and in 1973, respectively, they
were the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter (in 1973 and 1974). At
Jupiter, Pioneer 11&rsquo;s trajectory was carefully targeted to swing it
toward Saturn for an encounter in September 1979. We see some of
the early results in this publication.</p>
<p>Other spacecraft are following along the trail blazed by Pioneer
Saturn. Voyager 1 passed by Jupiter in March 1979 and will reach
Saturn in November 1980. Voyager 2 has also passed beyond Jupiter
and will encounter Saturn in August 1981, with the further possibility
of traveling on to Uranus (a 1986 encounter). Under development
are the Galileo orbiter and atmospheric entry probe, destined to
journey to Jupiter where the orbiter will return more detailed
information, including high-resolution pictures of the Galilean
satellites, and the probe will penetrate deep below the Jovian clouds.</p>
<p>In the coming years, each of these follow-on missions will enrich
our understanding of the solar system, greatly supplementing the
observations of Pioneers 10 and 11. But one thing will never change.
The Pioneers were first.</p>

<p>Pioneer Saturn has given us our first close view of the spectacular
ringed planet Saturn and its system of moons. The spacecraft began
its journey to the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn on April 5, 1973,
as Pioneer 11. It reached Jupiter on December 2, 1974, passing
within 42,760 km of the Jovian cloud tops and taking the only existing
pictures of Jupiter&rsquo;s polar regions. Jupiter&rsquo;s massive gravitational
field was used to swing Pioneer 11 back across the solar system
toward Saturn. Additional maneuvers were executed in 1975 and
1976 to place the spacecraft on a suitable trajectory, with the
final aimpoint selected in 1977.</p>
<p>From the many possible targeting options for the first Saturn
flyby, two aimpoints were considered, both of which would result in
a near-equatorial flyby that would give the best mapping of the high-energy
particles and the magnetic field near the planet. The difference
between these two aimpoints, which came to be known as the
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo; options, was their relationship to Saturn&rsquo;s
unique ring system first discovered by Galileo in 1610. The &ldquo;outside&rdquo;
option was finally selected because it was considered to be of
less risk to the spacecraft and more valuable in planning the subsequent
encounter of Saturn by Voyager 2, which will reach Saturn in
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
1981. Final targeting was completed during early 1978, when a series
of timed rocket thrusts locked Pioneer into the desired trajectory.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1979, the spacecraft, now designated Pioneer
Saturn, reached Saturn after 6 years in flight. It passed through the
ring plane outside the edge of Saturn&rsquo;s A-ring and then swung in
under the rings from 2,000 to 10,000 km below them. At the point
of closest approach, it attained a speed of 114,100 km/h
(71,900 mi/h) and came within 21,400 km of the planet&rsquo;s cloud
tops. While it was approaching, encountering, and leaving Saturn, the
spacecraft took the first closeup pictures of the planet, showing
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
20 to 30 times more detail than the best pictures taken from Earth,
and made the first close measurements of its rings and several of its
moons, including the largest moon, the planet-sized Titan. Titan,
along with Mars, has been considered by many scientists to be the
most likely place to find life in the solar system.</p>
<p>Pioneer Saturn unraveled many mysteries. It determined that
Saturn has a magnetic field and trapped radiation belts, measured
the mass of Saturn and some of its moons, and studied the character
of Saturn&rsquo;s interior. It confirmed the presence and determined the
magnitude of an internal heat source for Saturn. Its instruments
studied the temperature distribution, composition, and other properties
of the clouds and atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, and took
photometric and polarization measurements of Iapetus, Rhea, Dione,
and Tethys. Pioneer may also have discovered a previously unknown
moon of Saturn. The spacecraft measured the mass, structure, and
other characteristics of Saturn&rsquo;s rings, and passed safely through the
outer E-ring, which posed a potential hazard for Pioneer. It also
discovered new rings. One of these rings, called the F-ring by the
Pioneer team, lies just outside the A-ring. The gap between the
F-ring and the A-ring has been tentatively designated the Pioneer
Division. The other new ring has been called the G-ring, which lies
well outside the F-ring.</p>
<p>Pioneer carries a scientific payload of 11 operating instruments;
another instrument, the asteroid/meteoroid detector, was turned off
in 1975. Two other experiments, celestial mechanics and S-band
occultation of Saturn, use the spacecraft radio to obtain data.
Pioneer Saturn is a spinning spacecraft, which gives its instruments a
full-circle scan 7.8 times a minute. It uses a nuclear source for
electric power because the sunlight at Jupiter and beyond is too
weak for a solar-powered system.</p>
<p>Two booms project from the spacecraft to deploy the nuclear
power source about 3 meters from the sensitive spacecraft instrumentation.
A third boom positions the magnetometer sensor about
6 meters from the spacecraft. Six thrusters provide velocity, attitude,
and spin-rate control. A dish antenna is located along the spin axis
and looks back at Earth throughout the mission, adjusting its view by
changes in spacecraft attitude as the spacecraft and Earth move in
their orbits around the sun.</p>
<p>Tracking facilities of NASA&rsquo;s Deep Space Network, located at
Goldstone, California, and in Spain and Australia, supported Pioneer
Saturn during interplanetary flight and encounter. Pioneer&rsquo;s radio
signals, traveling at the speed of light, took 85 minutes to reach
Earth from Saturn, a round-trip time of almost 3 hours, somewhat
complicating ground control of the spacecraft. Almost 10,000
commands were sent to the spacecraft in the 2-week period before
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
closest approach. Continued communications should be possible
through at least the mid 1980&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After the spacecraft passed Saturn, it headed out of the solar system,
traveling in the direction the solar system moves with respect to
the local stars in our galaxy and in approximately an opposite direction
from its sister spacecraft, Pioneer 10. Both spacecraft have
plaques attached to them which contain a message from Earth for
any intelligent species that may intercept the spacecraft during their
endless journeys through interstellar space.</p>

<p>Saturn, called the wonder of the heavens by early astronomers, has
been studied from Earth for many centuries. When Galileo first
focused his telescope on Saturn in 1610, he realized that the appearance
of the planet was unusual, but he never knew its real character
because the power of his homemade telescope was far too low. He
thought he was looking at three globes, one large and two small,
which seemed to change slowly in appearance. In 1655, Huygens,
after years of observing the planet, finally realized that these projections
were actually a flat ring slightly separated from the main globe.</p>

years he also detected some of Saturn&rsquo;s moons.</p>

</div>
<p>The earliest successful photograph of Saturn was taken in 1883 by
Andrew Common. In 1895, James Keeler suggested that the rings are
in fact a swarm of particles in near-independent orbits. These rings,
until the recent discoveries of faint ring systems around Jupiter and
Uranus, were considered unique in the solar system.</p>
<p>Since Galileo first used his homemade telescope to view Saturn,
there have been many observers. There have also been major
advances in telescopes; a resulting modern view of Saturn is shown
on the next page. The corresponding sketch shows the nomenclature
of the brightest rings.</p>
<p>Now the planet has been seen for the first time not from Earth,
but in much closer views by an instrument on a spacecraft, the
imaging photopolarimeter on Pioneer Saturn. The instrument separately
measures the strengths of the red and blue components of sunlight
scattered from the clouds of Saturn and converts this information
into numbers. The data are transmitted to Earth as part of the
spacecraft telemetry. The signals are then converted by computer
into shades of gray on photographic film, and the two components
plus a synthesized green image can be recombined into a color image
that approximates the planet&rsquo;s true color. Some of the resulting
images are shown on the pages following the Earth-based view. These
pictures were produced by a scientific team from the University of
Arizona.</p>
<p>These images, while helping to unravel some of the mystery surrounding
the planet, have created even more interest regarding it. We
are really just beginning to know Saturn. It is up to future spacecraft
to more completely reveal her secrets and solve her mysteries.</p>

the different angle between the sun, the rings, and the spacecraft. When this picture

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">SCIENCE HIGHLIGHTS</span></h2>
<p>Pioneer Saturn has already greatly expanded our knowledge of
Saturn, its rings and moons. We now know that Saturn, in many
ways, represents an intermediate case between Jupiter, the largest
planet in the solar system, and Earth. The composition of Saturn&rsquo;s
interior is essentially the same as Jupiter&rsquo;s, differing only in the size
and extent of the various internal layers. Measurements for Saturn
are consistent with a central core of molten heavy elements (probably
mostly iron) which is the approximate size of the entire Earth,
but about three times more massive. Surrounding the central core is
an outer core of highly compressed hot, liquefied volatiles such as
methane, ammonia, and water. This outer core is equivalent to
approximately nine Earth masses. These core regions, however,
represent a very small fraction of the planet, which is composed primarily
of the very lightest gases, hydrogen and helium, and is almost
100 times the mass of the Earth. Because of the high pressure in
Saturn&rsquo;s interior, the hydrogen is transformed to its liquid metallic
state. Above this metallic hydrogen shell are liquid molecular hydrogen
and Saturn&rsquo;s gaseous atmosphere and clouds, which make up the
rest of the planet.</p>
<p>Electrical currents set up within the metallic hydrogen shell produce
Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic field, which was measured by Pioneer. In
spite of Saturn&rsquo;s large size, the magnetic field at the cloud tops is
only slightly weaker than the field at the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Saturn is
unique in that its magnetic axis is nearly aligned with its rotation
axis, unlike Earth and Jupiter.</p>
<p>Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic field is also much more regular in shape than the
fields of the other planets. At large distances from Saturn, the magnetic
field is deformed by the inward pressure of the solar wind.
Near the noon meridian (close to the inbound Pioneer trajectory),
the solar wind causes a compression of the field; in the dawn meridian
(close to the outbound trajectory), the field is swept back and
presumably forms a long magnetic tail. In both cases, Pioneer Saturn
crossed the outer boundary of the magnetic field several times as the
field moved in and out, responding to changing solar wind pressure.
Pioneer also observed inward and outward boundaries.</p>
<p>The magnetic envelope surrounding Saturn is intermediate in size
and energetic particle population between those of the Earth and
Jupiter, the only two other planets known to be strongly magnetized.
The three other planets investigated thus far (Venus, Mars, and
Mercury) and Earth&rsquo;s moon have little or no magnetism. Virtually all
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
our knowledge of Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic environment has been obtained
by Pioneer. The spacecraft found rings of particulate material and
several small moons near the rings, which strongly affect Saturn&rsquo;s
trapped radiation. These features provide important diagnostic capabilities.
A unique finding is the nearly total absence of radiation belt
particles at distances closer to the planet than the outer edge of
the visible rings.</p>
<p>The inner region of the thick magnetic envelope of Saturn, called
the magnetosphere, contains trapped high-energy electrons and protons,
with some evidence for heavier nuclei. The overall form of the
magnetosphere is simple and compact, more similar to that of Earth
than of Jupiter. The unique measuring capabilities of the Pioneer
Saturn radiation detectors led directly to the discovery of a diffuse
new ring of particulate matter in the region from about 10 to
15 planetary radii (1 Saturn radius = 60,000 km) from Saturn. This
ring has been tentatively designated as the G-ring. The G-ring clearly
causes particle absorption near the equatorial region. Moreover,
Pioneer discovered another region inside 7 or 8 planetary radii in
which the radiation belt particles were subjected to a strong loss or
absorption, presumably caused by the presence of an extensive cloud
of plasma corotating with the planet.</p>
<p>Inside about 10 planetary radii, the trapped radiation shows a high
degree of axial symmetry around Saturn and is consistent with the
centered dipole magnetic field observed by Pioneer. Saturn&rsquo;s rings
annihilate all trapped radiation at the outer edge of the A-ring, leaving
a shielded region close to the planet in which the radiation intensity
is the lowest so far encountered in this mission. This shielding
prevents the further buildup of electron intensities at lower altitudes,
which otherwise would have been present and would have made
Saturn a strong radio source observable from Earth.</p>
<p>Pioneer found that several of Saturn&rsquo;s moons absorb trapped particles
from the radiation belts, producing prominent dips in the
intensity. The effectiveness of absorption at the moons Tethys and
Enceladus is particularly astonishing, and supports the idea that
radiation belt particles are drifting inward slowly across the moons&rsquo;
orbits.</p>
<p>A precipitous decrease in particle intensity, lasting only for about
12 seconds, was observed over a wide range of energies for both protons
and electrons at a distance near 2.53 Saturn radii, 23 minutes
after Pioneer crossed the Saturn ring plane inbound. At about the
same time, an anomaly was also observed in the magnetic field measurements.
These phenomena have been tentatively interpreted as
indicating the presence of a nearby massive body absorbing the
trapped radiation and perturbing Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic field. The estimated
radius of this object lies in the range of 100 to 300 km,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
based on the effectiveness with which it absorbed the high-energy
radiation. The total radiation dose received at Saturn was equivalent
to only 2 minutes in the Jovian radiation belts because Saturn&rsquo;s
radiation belts were so much weaker.</p>
<p>In addition to images of Saturn, the brightness, color, and polarization
of the reflected light were also measured by the imaging
photopolarimeter on Pioneer Saturn. These measurements are used
to study the cloud layers of Saturn and Titan and to model the
vertical structure of the atmospheres of these two bodies. In the
scans that made the images, the banded structures of Saturn and of
the rings were obtained in fine detail. These are essential in studying
the atmosphere, rings, and moons. A new Saturnian ring, which has
been tentatively designated the F-ring, was discovered in the images.
It is narrower than 500 km in width, but is important because it
forms an outside barrier to the bright A- and B-rings. The gap
between the F- and A-rings has been designated the Pioneer Division
by the Pioneer team. A small moon, which either was previously
unknown or had been previously discovered from Earth but lost
again, was found in the Pioneer Saturn images. After its initial
discovery, this new moon continued on its 17-hour orbit around the
planet and passed near Pioneer as the spacecraft entered the ring
system. It is quite conceivable that this moon is the same one that
perturbed the radiation belt particles and produced the anomaly in
the magnetic field measurements.</p>
<p>Infrared observations obtained during the Saturn flyby revealed
the temperatures in the atmospheres of Saturn and the rings and in
the atmosphere of Titan. It was found that Saturn has a temperature
of about 100 K (about 280&deg;F below zero) and, according to these
observations, has an internal heat source of enough strength that the
planet emits approximately 2.5 times as much energy as it absorbs
from the sun. The equatorial yellowish band observable in many of
the images was found to be several degrees colder than the planet at
other latitudes and is probably a zone of high clouds resembling
similar zones on Jupiter. As expected, the rings were extremely cold,
65 to 75 K (about 330&deg;F below zero), at the time of encounter. The
temperature differences between the illuminated and unilluminated
sides of the rings, and the rate of cooling as the ring particles go into
Saturn&rsquo;s shadow, suggest that the ring particles are at least several
centimeters in diameter and the rings themselves are many particle
diameters thick. The very minor perturbation to Pioneer&rsquo;s trajectory,
as it passed under the visible rings, indicates that the rings probably
consist of ices.</p>
<p>As Pioneer passed through Saturn&rsquo;s ring system, very sensitive
meteoroid detectors observed the impact of five particles on the
spacecraft, particles that were about 10 micrometers (0.0005 inch)
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
in diameter. Two impacts occurred while the spacecraft was above
the rings and three while the spacecraft was below the rings. No
impacts were detected going through the ring plane, but the Pioneer
instrument cannot detect individual impacts that occur less than
77 minutes apart. This characteristic would have prevented detection
of ring particles because of the impacts detected just before both ring
plane crossings. It is uncertain whether the micrometeoroids detected
by Pioneer Saturn were stray ring particles deflected out of Saturn&rsquo;s
ring plane or whether they were particles from interplanetary space
drawn inward toward Saturn by its strong gravitational field.</p>
<p>Close to the point of closest approach to Saturn, the spacecraft&rsquo;s
radio transmissions were affected by Saturn&rsquo;s ionosphere. The
manner in which the radio signals were absorbed indicates that
Saturn has an extensive ionosphere composed of ionized atomic
hydrogen with a temperature of about 1250 K in its upper regions.
This high temperature requires an extensive energy source other than
the sun. This phenomenon was also observed at Jupiter.</p>
<p>Pioneer measured ultraviolet glow throughout the Saturnian system.
This ultraviolet glow is due to the scattering of the light from
the sun by atomic hydrogen. The observations of ultraviolet emission
from an extensive cloud of hydrogen gas surrounding Saturn&rsquo;s visible
rings are especially interesting. The rings themselves are presumably
the source of this hydrogen. On the planet&rsquo;s disk, the ultraviolet
observations show significant latitude variations, suggesting the possibility
of aurora near Saturn&rsquo;s polar regions. A similar extensive cloud
of hydrogen was also seen partially surrounding Titan&rsquo;s orbit.</p>
<p>These very preliminary findings by Pioneer Saturn represent only
a small fraction of what will ultimately be learned about Saturn and
its environment as the spacecraft data are analyzed in greater detail
over the weeks and months ahead.</p>

<p class="pcap">Schematic of the solar wind interaction with Saturn&rsquo;s magnetosphere. The solar
wind arrives from the direction of the sun, is deflected at Saturn&rsquo;s bow shock,
and flows around Saturn in the magnetosheath (orange region), as indicated by
the arrows. The sizes of the magnetosheath and radiation belts change in
response to the external solar-wind pressure, becoming smaller when the external
pressure is larger and vice versa.</p>

<p class="pcap">Diagram of Saturn&rsquo;s inner trapped radiation belts. The energetic particle fluxes
generally become more intense closer to Saturn. Decreases in particle flux at the
locations of Saturn&rsquo;s moons are due to the sweeping up of the energetic particles
caused by particles striking the moons and being absorbed by them. Also, there
are decreases in particle flux at the outer edge of the rings, where the energetic
particles are also absorbed, so that a region free of trapped radiation is created
from the outer edge of the rings to Saturn.</p>

<p class="pcap">Infrared radiometer image of Saturn and its rings. Brightness in the image is
related to temperature, with the brightest areas at about 100 K (about -280&deg;F).
The left version shows contrast in the colder regions (the rings). The right
version shows contrast in the warmer regions (the planet). The image contains
many separate scans from top to bottom. Each scan is displaced to the right
from the one before by the motion of the spacecraft. The spacecraft was below
the ring plane during most of the 3-hour observation period and was much closer
to the planet at the end of the period (right of image) than at the start (left of
image). Thus, the images are quite distorted. The small-scale pattern is instrument
noise. In the left image, the warm infrared radiation from the planet is seen
through Cassini&rsquo;s Division between the A- and B-rings. The brightness level in the
right image implies that Saturn emits heat at a rate that is 2.5 times the rate that
it absorbs energy from the sun.</p>

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
